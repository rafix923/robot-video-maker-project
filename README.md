My journey in this project

fev, 28th - march, 09th
As a complete beginner, I had to study the basics of git and git hub. I accomplished that by studying the tutorials and manuals in Git and GitHub sites. Then I watched some tutorials on youtube to review and consolidate my knowledge. And after some excercises, I learned how to work in my projects and in another projects as a team using github to upload projects, make brunchs, reviews, tags, push, pull and merges.
Note: I will start my fullstack course in march, 28. So, studying how to use git and github will be usefull in this course!

march, 10th
Started to study how watson works. The mainly source of infomratiion was the IBM site. There I also found some interesting classes about artificial intelligence, and how to make a chat bot. Important to mention that the courses are totally free and they have an excellente course catolog.
