My journey in this project

fev, 28 - 
As a complete beginner, I had to study the basics of git and git hub. I accomplished that by studying the tutorials and manual in Git and GitHub sites. Then I watched some tutorials on youtube to review and consolidate my knowledge. Here I learned how to work in my projects and anothers projects as a team using github to upload projects, make brunchs, reviews, push, pull and merges.
Note: I will start my fullstack course in march, 28. So, studying how to use git and github will be usefull in this course ;)
